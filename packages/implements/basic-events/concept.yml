name: BASIC_EVENT
implements: EVENT
type: concrete
description: |
  File-based implementation of the EVENT concept.
  
  Uses YAML files for storage:
  - .cm/events/events.yml - chronological event log
  - .cm/events/subscriptions.yml - handler subscriptions
  
  Execution model:
  - Synchronous by default
  - Priority-based handler ordering (lower number = higher priority)
  - Handlers execute in isolation with try/catch
  - Failed handlers don't stop other handlers
  - Cascade support (handlers can emit new events)
  - Max cascade depth: 10 (protection from infinite loops)

storage:
  events_log: .cm/events/events.yml
  subscriptions: .cm/events/subscriptions.yml
